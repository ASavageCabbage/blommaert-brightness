# divnorm-brightness
Python implementation of divisive normalization based brightness model,
inspired by Blommaert and Martens's [object-oriented brightness perception model](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Bernard-Martens/publication/20879982_An_object-oriented_model_for_brightness_perception/links/5ba0facc299bf13e6039c636/An-object-oriented-model-for-brightness-perception.pdf)
and Aqil et al's [divisive normalization model](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2108713118).
